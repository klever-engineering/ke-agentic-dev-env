# Context Engineering

This folder separates raw context intake from curated agent-ready context.

## Structure

- `input/`: raw incoming material
- `sources/`: curated context artifacts
- `support/`: templates, processing logs, helpers

## Lifecycle

1. ingest into `input/`
2. curate into `sources/`
3. document processing in `support/`
