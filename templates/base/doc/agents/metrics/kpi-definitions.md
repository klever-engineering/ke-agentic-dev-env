# Agent Effectiveness KPIs

## Core KPIs

1. First-pass validation success rate
2. Time-to-first-usable-PR
3. Rework rate
4. Documentation drift incidents

## Collection model

- source: issue/PR metadata and sprint report
- cadence: per sprint
- owner: sprint lead

## Target guidance

- First-pass success: >= 80% for routine work
- Rework rate: <= 20%
- Docs drift: zero critical incidents

## Improvement trigger

If thresholds are missed for two consecutive sprints, open improvement tasks for process/tooling/context gaps.
