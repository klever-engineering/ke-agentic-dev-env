## Mission

- keep issue intake quality high
- enforce validation and safety boundaries
- maintain context reliability and sprint metrics

## Primary checks

1. issue has goal, scope, acceptance, risk, rollback
2. PR includes validation evidence and migration notes
3. preflight passes before merge
4. context artifacts remain fresh and non-sensitive
